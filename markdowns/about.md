#### About Me
<img src='images/zack-headshot.jpg' class='zack-headshot'/>
I graudated with my Bachelors from Texas State in 2013, and moved to Dallas soon after. Since then I have taken on a multitude of jobs, but finally found my calling as a Real Estate Agent and Design Consultant in 2015. I have always felt I had a creative touch (I did work at a flower shop for a bit a a teen), and glad I found a great outlet to be creative and provde a quality service to my clients.

I pride myself on my ability to self manage and deliver what I promise. These values I carry with me into Praxis Homes as its Founder. And will always strive to give my clients A+ treatment and deliver what they want.
